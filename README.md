Microsoft Build 2025 is aimed to showcase innovative ideas, collaborate with Microsoft and ecosystem partners, and contribute to the global developer community. This repository demonstrates a quantum computing approach to DNA sequence alignment using Q#, aligning with Buildâ€™s mission to push technological boundaries and foster developer collaboration.
QuantumDNAEncoding Requirements
Follow these steps to set up and run the QuantumDNAAlignment.qs code, leveraging Visual Studio Code and the Azure Quantum Development Kit (QDK) to execute quantum DNA encoding on real quantum hardware.
Install Visual Studio Code
Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to serve as your development environment for editing and debugging Q# code.  

Install Azure Quantum Development Kit (QDK) Extension
Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on Mac), search for Azure Quantum Development Kit, and install it. This extension provides Q# language support and Azure Quantum integration.  

Download and Open the Code in VS Code
Clone or download this repository, then open the QuantumDNAAlignment.qs file in VS Code via File > Open File. This prepares the code for local simulation or remote execution.  

Run on Real Quantum Hardware via Azure Portal
Log into the Azure Portal, search for Azure Quantum in the Marketplace, and create a Quantum workspace. Connect your workspace in VS Code using the QDK extension, then submit the Q# code to run on real quantum hardware (e.g., IonQ or Quantinuum).
